## ℹ Intro

### 📖 Background

`rworkflows` is a suite of tools to make it easy for R developers to
implement reproducible best practices on GitHub.

It includes three main components:  
1. [**`templateR`
template**](https://github.com/neurogenomics/templateR): a
`CRAN`/`Bioc`-compatible R package template that automatically generates
essential documentation using package metadata.  
2. [**`rworkflows` R
package**](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/blob/master/DESCRIPTION):
a lightweight `CRAN` package to automatically set up short, customisable
workflows that trigger the `rworkflows` action.  
3. [**`rworkflows`
action**](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/blob/master/action.yml):
an open-source action available on the [GitHub Actions
Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rworkflows).

### ⚙️ `rworkflows` action steps

[**GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are a powerful
way to automatically launch workflows every time you push changes to a
GitHub repository. This is a form of [**Continuous
Integration/Deployment
(CI/CD)**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration),
which helps ensure that your code is always working as expected (without
having to manually check each time).

Here, we have designed a robust, reusable, and flexible **action**
specifically for the development of R packages. We also provide an R
function to automatically generate a **workflow file** that calls the
`rworkflows` composite action:

Currently, `rworkflows` **action** can perform the following tasks (with
options to enable/disable/modify each step):

1.  🐳 Builds a Docker container to run subsequent steps within.
2.  🐍 Builds and/or activates a custom `conda` environment.
3.  🛠️ Installs system dependencies
4.  🛠️ Installs LaTeX dependencies.
5.  🛠 Installs R dependencies.
6.  ✅ Builds and checks your R package (with
    [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/) and/or
    [**Bioconductor**](https://bioconductor.org/) checks).  
7.  📋 Runs [unit tests](https://testthat.r-lib.org/).  
8.  📋 Runs [code coverage tests](https://covr.r-lib.org/) and uploads
    the results to [**Codecov**](https://about.codecov.io/).  
9.  🚀 (Re)builds and launches a documentation website for your R
    package.  
10. 🐳 Pushes a [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) container (with
    [**Rstudio**](https://posit.co/) and all dependencies pre-installed)
    to your choice of container registry (e.g. [**GitHub Container
    Registry**](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry),
    [**DockerHub**](https://hub.docker.com/)).
11. 🔭 Generates [workflow
    telemetry](https://github.com/runforesight/workflow-telemetry-action)
    report.  
12. 🎖 Updates relevant badges added to your README with
    `rworkflows::use_badges()`.

Importantly, this **workflow** is designed to work with any R package
out-of-the-box. This means you won’t have to manually edit any yaml
files, just run the `rworkflows::use_workflow()` function and you’re
ready to go within seconds!

## ⏩ Quickstart

Install and create the workflow in your R package’s project folder.

In R (only need to do once per repository):

``` r
### 1. Install stable CRAN release
if(!require("rworkflows")) install.packages("rworkflows")
### Or, install latest development version
# if(!require("rworkflows")) remotes::install_github("neurogenomics/rworkflows")

### 2. Create workflow file
path <- rworkflows::use_workflow()
```

Then, in the Terminal:

``` bash
### 3. Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Added rworkflows" # Arbitrary commit message
git push
```

Now you can let everything run on GitHub automatically! You can check
the status of your workflow by clicking on the [*Actions*
tab](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/actions) in your GitHub
repo.

### 🤫 Special commit messages

Including special keywords in your commit message will have a certain
effect:  
- `"[skip ci]"`: will skip running the workflow on this push.  
- `"[nodocker]"`: will skip any Docker registry steps.  
- `"[noncache]"`: will not use any cached installations or files.

For example: `git commit -m "Update README [skip ci]"` will skip running
any GitHub Actions.

### 🔐 GitHub Secrets

To use certain features of `rworkflows`, you may need to set up one or
more [GitHub
Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets):

- `PAT_GITHUB` \[Optional\]: Can grant access to private repos on GitHub
  Actions. You can generate your very own Personal Authentication Token
  with `usethis::create_github_token()`. [See
  more](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).  
- `DOCKER_TOKEN` \[Optional\]: Allows GitHub Actions to push to a
  [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) account. [See
  more](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/).  
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` \[Optional\]: Bypasses issues that occasionally arise
  from GitHub API limits. [See
  more](https://docs.codecov.com/reference/overview).

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

`rworkflows` builds upon the work of many others, especially the
following:

- [`biocthis`](https://github.com/lcolladotor/biocthis): This workflow
  is largely inspired by the workflow generated by the
  [`use_bioc_github_action()`](https://lcolladotor.github.io/biocthis/articles/biocthis.html)
  function within the
  [`biothis`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biocthis.html)
  package, developed by @lcolladotor. Key changes in `rworkflows`
  - Uses dynamic variables to specify R/Bioconductor versions
    (e.g. `r: "latest"`) and the name of your R package, as opposed to
    static names that are likely to become outdated
    (e.g. `r: "4.0.1"`).  
  - Additional error handling and dependencies checks.  
  - Re-renders `README.Rmd` before rebuilding the documentation
    website.  
  - Conda support
  - Ability to change registry  
- [`usethis`](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis): `biocthis` was in turn
  inspired by `usethis`.  
- [`actions/`](https://github.com/actions): A general set of **GitHub
  Actions** maintained by the core GitHub team.  
- [`r-lib/actions`](https://github.com/r-lib/actions): A set of **GitHub
  Actions** for R development maintained by the Rstudio/Posit team.  
- [`bioc-actions`](https://github.com/grimbough/bioc-actions)
  [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/)-oriented **GitHub
  Actions** created by @grimbough.  
- [`JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action):
  Builds and deploys the **GitHub Pages** documentation website in the
  `rworkflows` GHA workflows.  
- [`docker/build-push-action`](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action):
  A set of **GitHub Actions** for building/pushing **Docker**
  containers.  
- [`bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker):
  Uses the official
  [`bioconductor/bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker)
  **Docker** container.
  - **Note**: Whenever a new version of Bioconductor is released, the
    `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` container will often lag behind
    the actual. Bioconductor releases for up to several days, due to the
    time it takes to update the container. This means that sometimes
    “devel” in `Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` is actually referring
    to the current “release” version of Bioconductor (i.e. the previous
    Bioc version’s “devel”). For further details, see this
    [Issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/issues/37),
    and the [Bioconductor release
    schedule](https://www.bioconductor.org/about/release-announcements/).  
- [`scFlow`](https://github.com/combiz/scFlow): The `rworkflows`
  Dockerfile template was partly adapted from the [scFlow
  Dockerfile](https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/blob/master/Dockerfile).
  Unlike other Dockerfiles, this one does not require any manual editing
  when applying to different R packages. This means that users who are
  unfamiliar with **Docker** do not have to troubleshoot making this
  file correctly. It also means that it will continue to work even if
  your R package dependencies change.
- [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act): A very useful command line
  tool for testing **GitHub Actions** locally.
- [`actions/runner-images`](https://github.com/actions/runner-images):
  Runner images for each OS provided by GitHub.  
- [`actions/setup-miniconda`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-miniconda):
  GitHub Action to setup Miniconda and conda environments.
